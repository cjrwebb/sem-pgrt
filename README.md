# An Introduction to Structural Equation Modelling Using R

#### Dr. Calum J. R. Webb, Sheffield Methods Institute, the University of Sheffield

This repository contains the course materials for the one day training course *'An Introduction to Structural Equation Modelling Using R'*, for postgraduate research students and research professionals. These materials should be downloaded prior to the start of the course, and the instructions in the `prep-script.R` file should be followed to ensure that your device is ready for the training course. Instructions are provided for computers running Windows, Mac, or Debian/Ubuntu systems. Other devices (iPhones, iPads, Android-based devices) are not suitable for the training course unless you also have access to an Rstudio server and can confidently configure an Rstudio server instance. 

The course is designed to be 'hands-on' to ensure that you are able to apply the statistical techniques and quantitative methods that are taught in a real research context.

If you are new to `R` and `Rstudio`, you will first need to install and configure the statistical programming language and the GUI on your device. 

Completing all of the setting up steps for the course should take no longer than an hour.


## Installing R and Rstudio

If you have never used R or Rstudio before, the first thing you will need to do is install both the programming language (`R`) and the GUI (graphical user interface, `Rstudio`). I recommend following [this guide from R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites). 

In short: 

1) First, go to [https://cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org), download and install the latest version of `R` for your operating system. If you do not know your computer's operating system (Windows, Mac, etc.), and if you're a Mac user and do not know whether you have an Intel-based or an Apple Silicon based Mac, I recommend speaking to your University IT Helpdesk. For students at the University of Sheffield, IT services information can be [found here](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services)

2) Next, go to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), download and install the latest version of `Rstudio` for your operating system. 

3) Try opening `Rstudio`, **not R**, and see whether the screen you are greeted with looks like the one shown in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites).
